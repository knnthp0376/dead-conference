Explore topics like "How to Maintain Power While Looking Fabulous" with Hannibal Lecter, "Disrupting the World: How to Use Technology to Dominate" with our Evil Tech Billionaire, and "Divine Interference: How Gods Keep Ruining Your Best Laid Evil Plans" for when those pesky higher powers get in the way. And of course, don&rsquo;t miss our keynote: "Mastering the Dark Arts of Leadership" by Prince John, the guest of honor, where you&rsquo;ll learn how to command your kingdom with just a pinch of greed and a dash of betrayal.</p> <br>
           <p>So, if you&rsquo;re tired of being a mere mortal and ready to embrace your dark side, the DEAD Conference is the place to be. Come for the knowledge, stay for the chaos, and leave with your soul... well, at least half of it.</p>

            <h2>HANNNIBAL LECTOR</h2>
            <h3>"Murderous Charm: How to Win Friends and Influence People (Without Actually Killing Them)"</h3>
            <p>Join Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the world-renowned psychiatrist and connoisseur of fine cuisine, for a breakout session like no other. Learn how to win people over, bend them to your will, and leave them begging for more—figuratively, of course. Dr. Lecter will walk you through the art of persuasion with a touch of elegance and a dash of subtlety (and perhaps a sprinkle of cannibalism, but we&rsquo;ll keep that between us). Expect to learn the fine balance of being polite, persuasive, and just a little bit terrifying—all without needing to invest in a good set of shackles.</p><br>
            <p>He&rsquo;ll also discuss the importance of taste—not just in fine dining, but in the people you choose to associate with. By the end of the session, you&rsquo;ll understand how to get ahead in life with charisma, intellect, and a little bit of finesse. Come for the charm, stay for the psychological insights... and the fine wine!</p>

Whether you&rsquo;re running an empire, a business, or just trying to control your own household, Caligula&rsquo;s tips and tricks will show you how to dominate with impunity (and maybe a little madness).</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>How to Make Everyone Think You&rsquo;re the Best (Even When You&rsquo;re Clearly Not)</li>
                <li>The Power of Disrespect: Why You Shouldn't Listen to Advisors, Senators, or Reality</li>
                <li>Why Having a Horse as a Consul is Actually a Genius Idea (And Other Leadership Strategies)</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Caligula's session will be brimming with outrageous suggestions, bizarre anecdotes, and a touch of cruelty—because, let’s face it, what&rsquo;s an empire without a little fun? By the end, you'll have mastered the art of running things your way—no matter how ridiculous it gets.</p>
